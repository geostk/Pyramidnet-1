# A PyTorch Implementation of PyramidNet

This is a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of the
Pyramid type architecture as described in the
paper [Deep Pyramidal Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02915)
by Dongyoon Han*, Jiwhan Kim*, and Junmo Kim.
Their official implementation and links to many other
third-party implementations are available in the
[jhkim89/PyramidNet](https://github.com/jhkim89/PyramidNet)
repo on GitHub.
